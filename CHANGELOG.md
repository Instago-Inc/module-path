## v1.0.1 - Streamlined Instago path docs
Clarified the module/path documentation to spotlight the `joinURL` helper within the Instago V8 runtime and make it easier to find usage patterns. Added a compact technical reference so developers see exports, configuration, and examples at a glance.

### Added
- Added a technical reference section describing the `joinURL` export, usage snippet, and configuration note in ReadMe.MD.

### Changed
- Simplified the module overview and aligned the test dependencies with `path@latest` to match the refreshed documentation.
